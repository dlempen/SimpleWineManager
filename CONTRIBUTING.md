   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes following the coding standards below

3. Test your changes thoroughly:
   - Build and run on iOS Simulator
   - Test on physical device if possible
   - Verify all existing functionality still works

4. Commit your changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: description of your changes"
   ```

5. Push and create a pull request:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
