# Print Page Break Fix Summary
**Date: July 21, 2025**

## 🐛 Issue Fixed

**Problem**: Wine list text was getting cut horizontally across page breaks. The upper half of text would appear at the bottom of one page and the lower half at the top of the next page.

**Root Cause**: The CSS was using `white-space: nowrap` and `text-overflow: ellipsis` everywhere, which prevented text from wrapping naturally and caused entries to be truncated with "..." instead of flowing properly.

## ✅ Solution Applied

### Key Changes Made:

1. **Removed problematic `white-space: nowrap` rules**
   - Was preventing text from wrapping within wine entries
   - Replaced with `word-wrap: break-word` and `overflow-wrap: break-word`

2. **Enhanced page break prevention**
   - Kept `page-break-inside: avoid` on wine entries (prevents splitting wine rows)
   - Kept `page-break-after: avoid` on section headers (prevents orphaned headers)
   - Improved `orphans` and `widows` handling for better text flow

3. **Improved line spacing**
   - Increased line-height from 1.1 to 1.2-1.3 for better readability
   - Added proper margin spacing between wine entries
   - Increased minimum height for wine rows to accommodate wrapped text

4. **Fixed text wrapping behavior**
   - Wine names and details can now wrap to multiple lines if needed
   - Long producer names or wine details won't be cut off with "..."
   - Text flows naturally within each wine entry

### CSS Strategy:
- **Keep units together**: Wine entries, section headers, and blocks stay together
- **Allow text wrapping**: Long text can wrap within those units
- **Prevent horizontal text splitting**: No text gets cut across pages
- **Maintain visual style**: Same layout and typography as before

## 🎯 Expected Results

After this fix:
- ✅ **No more horizontal text cutting across pages**
- ✅ **Wine entries stay together as complete units**
- ✅ **Long wine names/details wrap properly instead of being truncated**
- ✅ **Section headers stay with their content**
- ✅ **Visual style preserved** (same fonts, spacing, layout)

## 🧪 Testing Recommended

1. **Print a long wine list** (20+ wines) to test page breaks
2. **Include wines with long names** to test text wrapping
3. **Test different paper sizes** (A4, Letter) to ensure compatibility
4. **Test with multiple section headers** to verify header behavior

## 📝 Technical Details

The fix changes the approach from:
- **Before**: Prevent all text wrapping → leads to truncation and splitting
- **After**: Allow text wrapping within units → prevents splitting while preserving content

This maintains the clean, professional print style you liked while fixing the page break issues.

**Result**: Your wine list prints should now flow properly across pages without any text getting cut in half! 🍷
