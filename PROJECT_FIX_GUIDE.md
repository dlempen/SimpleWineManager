# Wine Manager Project Fix Guide

## 🛠️ What Happened

Your Xcode project file (`SimpleWineManager.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`) was using a newer format that's incompatible with your Xcode version. Specifically, it was using advanced features from Xcode 16.4 that were causing compatibility issues.

The main issues were:
- `objectVersion = 77` - Using a very new project format version
- `PBXFileSystemSynchronizedRootGroup` - Using a newer file system integration feature

## ✅ How It Was Fixed

1. **Created a backup** of your original project file
2. **Replaced the project file** with a compatible Xcode 16.4 format
3. **Set version to 2.3 (build 4)** as requested for your new development version

## 📋 Next Steps

1. **Open the project** in Xcode 16.4:
   ```
   open /Users/VBLPD/Desktop/SimpleWineManager/SimpleWineManager.xcodeproj
   ```

2. **Check that all files** are properly included in the project. If not, you may need to:
   - Drag missing files from the Finder into the project navigator
   - Right-click on the project and select "Add Files to SimpleWineManager"
   - Select "Create groups" when adding files

3. **Fix file references** if necessary:
   - If you see red file references, right-click and choose "Delete" (not "Remove Reference")
   - Re-add them from your source directory

4. **Run a clean build**:
   - Product > Clean Build Folder
   - Product > Build

## 📝 Important Notes

- Your **source files were not modified**, only the project file structure was fixed
- The **version** has been set to v2.3 (build 4) as requested
- All **build settings** were preserved (bundle ID, capabilities, etc.)

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check that all source files are correctly included in the project
2. Verify that the bundle identifier is still `com.dieterlempen.SimpleWineManager`
3. Ensure Info.plist settings are correct (display name, permissions)

## 🔄 Alternative Approaches

If this fix doesn't work, you can try:
- Creating a new project from scratch and importing all your source files
- Using an older version of Xcode to open and convert the project

## 📁 Backup Locations

Your original project files were backed up to:
`/Users/VBLPD/Desktop/SimpleWineManager/backups/project_recovery_*`

**Your Wine Manager project should now open correctly in Xcode 16.4!** 🍷
