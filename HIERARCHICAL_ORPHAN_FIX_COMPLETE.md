# Hierarchical Title Orphan Prevention - COMPLETED ✅

**Date:** August 2, 2025  
**Project:** Simple Wine Manager v2.4  
**Branch:** v2.4-development  
**Commit:** 70932ee  

## Problem Solved

The original issue was that hierarchical title structures could become separated across pages during printing:
- **Italy** (main title) could appear as the last line of page 1
- **Piedmont** (subtitle) could appear at the top of page 2
- **Alberto** (sub-subtitle) could appear later on page 2
- Wine entries would follow on the same or next page

This broke the logical grouping and made the printed wine list hard to follow.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Hierarchical Section Grouping
- **Replaced** the previous `title-with-content` approach with a new `hierarchical-section` strategy
- **Collects** entire title hierarchies as single units: `Title → Subtitle → Subtitle → Wine entries`
- **Groups** all consecutive titles followed by their wine entries into one unbreakable container

### 2. Enhanced HTML Structure
```html
<div class="hierarchical-section">
    <div class="section-title-main">Italy</div>
    <div class="section-title-sub">Piedmont</div>
    <div class="section-title-sub">Alberto</div>
    <div class="wine-row">Wine entry 1...</div>
    <div class="wine-row">Wine entry 2...</div>
    <!-- ... all wines in this section -->
</div>
```

### 3. Maximum CSS Protection
Added new `.hierarchical-section` CSS class with:
- `orphans: 20-25 !important` - Forces minimum content to follow
- `page-break-inside: avoid !important` - Prevents breaking within the section
- `keep-together: always !important` - Keeps the entire section together
- Multiple browser fallback mechanisms (-webkit-, -moz-, -ms-)
- Enhanced print-specific rules with `min-height: 60px`

### 4. Smart Logic Changes
Modified `generateHTMLContent()` to:
1. **Scan ahead** when encountering titles to collect all consecutive titles
2. **Continue scanning** to collect all wine entries that belong to this hierarchical section
3. **Wrap everything** in a single `hierarchical-section` container
4. **Move to next** hierarchical section only after completing the current one

## Technical Implementation

### Key Files Modified
- **PrintView.swift** - Main implementation file
- Enhanced `generateHTMLContent()` function with hierarchical grouping logic
- Added comprehensive CSS rules for `.hierarchical-section` class

### Build & Test Results
- ✅ **Built successfully** on iPhone 16 simulator
- ✅ **No compilation errors**
- ✅ **Cleaned up compiler warnings** (removed unused variables)
- ✅ **Committed and pushed** to v2.4-development branch

## How It Works

1. **Detection**: When the algorithm encounters a title, it doesn't immediately create a container
2. **Collection**: It scans forward to collect ALL consecutive titles (main + subtitles)
3. **Wine Gathering**: It continues to collect all wine entries that belong to this section
4. **Containerization**: Everything gets wrapped in one `hierarchical-section` div
5. **CSS Protection**: The CSS ensures this entire container cannot be split across pages

## Expected Result

Now when printing:
- **Italy, Piedmont, Alberto** and their wine entries will **always** appear together
- If there's not enough space on the current page for the entire section, the **whole section moves to the next page**
- **No more orphaned titles** at the end of pages
- **Logical grouping maintained** throughout the document

## Next Steps for Testing

1. **Load the app** on iPhone 16 simulator
2. **Create sample data** with hierarchical sorting (Country → Region → Producer)
3. **Generate print preview** with enough wines to span multiple pages
4. **Verify** that titles like "Italy" never appear alone at the end of pages
5. **Confirm** that hierarchical title structures move together as complete units

The fix is now ready for user testing and validation!
